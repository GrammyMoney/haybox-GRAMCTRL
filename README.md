# **OUTDATED, CURRENT FIRMWARE CAN BE FOUND [HERE](https://github.com/GRAMCTRL/HayBox-GRAM)**

 Haybox Build for GRAM Controllers.

 For official HayBox Documentation, as well as descriptions of how to build, modify, and use this code, refer to the original documentation [here](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayBox).

 *Massive shoutouts to [Johnny Haystack](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack), the goat himself, for building out the HayBox firmware and making it available to all of us. Additional shoutout to [Bloojay](https://github.com/UMS-Ultra) for [Bubblebox-WASD](https://github.com/UMS-Ultra/BubbleBox-Firmware/tree/BubbleBox-WASD-Firmware), the spiritial successor to this modification of the HayBox firmware.*

# Changes made:
**Introduction of a 21st "up2" button that acts as the up button in WASD modes. By default, the button acts as a D-Pad toggle (in the same way ModX+ModY does in the original firmware).**

**Made FGC mode in two variants, WASD and traditional leverless, so as to stay Capcom-legal.**

**Adjusted FGC mode to include Start, Select, and Home buttons for PS4/5 usage.**

**Changes to Ultimate mode (thanks [DBryce](https://github.com/dbryce712)!):**
- Midshield button changed to up taunt
- Mod X + Start = Select
- Mod Y + Start = Home
- Samus can now input Homing Missiles with Mod X + side B
- Mod X + Up/Down + B now outputs Up/Down special, respectively
- Fixed issue where inputting DAFTs using Mod X + A outputted non-angled forward tilts instead
- Fixed issue that caused Mod X + C-Right to output a leftward-facing attack
- Horizontal Mod Y magnitude decreased to 35 from 41
- Mod Y Pivot Uptilt/Dtilt now functions properly

**Added ROA2 mode on ModX+R+Start (Thanks [bread](https://github.com/7SlicesOfBread)!)**
